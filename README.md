Python Calculator - A Simple Arithmetic & Trigonometry Calculator
This repository contains a Python-based calculator that supports basic arithmetic operations as well as advanced trigonometric functions. It allows users to perform operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and calculates the least common multiple (LCM) and greatest common divisor (GCD). In addition, the calculator supports trigonometric functions including sine, cosine, and tangent, with angles provided in degrees.

Features:
Basic Arithmetic: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.

Advanced Operations: Least common multiple (LCM), greatest common divisor (GCD), and percentage calculations.

Trigonometric Functions: Sine, cosine, and tangent, with input in degrees (internally converted to radians).

Error Handling: Handles division by zero and undefined tangent values.

How It Works:
The user is presented with a menu of available operations.

After selecting an operation, the user is prompted to enter the required numbers (or angle for trigonometric operations).

The program performs the selected calculation and displays the result.

The program will continue displaying the menu after each calculation, allowing the user to perform additional operations or exit.

Example Usage:
Basic Operations: You can calculate sums, differences, products, quotients, and remainders with ease.

Trigonometry: For example, entering "30" will calculate the sine, cosine, and tangent of 30Â°.

LCM & GCD: The program also allows you to compute the least common multiple and greatest common divisor of two numbers.
